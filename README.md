# MindMirror
MindMirror is an AI tool that analyzes real-time speech to detect cognitive load, stress levels, and communication clarity. It uses voice and text patterns to spot inconsistencies but does not classify anything as true or false. Instead, it provides gentle insights and feedback to support better communication.
